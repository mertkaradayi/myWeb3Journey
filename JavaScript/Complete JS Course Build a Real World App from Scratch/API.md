# API (Application Programming Interface)

## What is API ? 

API stands for Application Programming Interface, which is a set of protocols, standards, and tools that allow different software applications to communicate with each other. APIs are commonly used in web development to '**allow applications to interact with each other and share data**'. They provide a standardized way for applications to communicate with each other, regardless of the programming languages or technologies used in each application. APIs typically define a set of rules or endpoints that can be accessed through HTTP requests, with responses returned in a specified format like JSON or XML.

### Tools for API:

- The web application for [Postman](https://web.postman.co/), a popular API development platform that allows developers to design, test, and document APIs.
