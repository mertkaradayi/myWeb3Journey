# myWeb3Journey

Welcome to myWeb3Journey, a repository where I store what I learn, practice, build, and explore in the exciting world of Web3 technologies.

Who am I ? 
I am a curious learner and a passionate explorer of the Web3 landscape. I love to experiment with new technologies, tools, and platforms, and share my discoveries with others. My goal is to become a proficient Web3 developer and build a strong portfolio of projects and code samples that showcase my skills and knowledge.

What is my learn objectives?
I am currently focused on learning and mastering two key technologies: Solidity and JavaScript. Solidity is the programming language used to write smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, while JavaScript is a versatile language used for both front-end and back-end development. In addition, I am also learning the fundamentals of blockchains, cryptography, and other Web3-related concepts.


As a Web3 enthusiast, I love to listen to music that inspires me and keeps me focused on my projects. That's why I created a Spotify playlist that is specifically designed for Web3 addicts like me. This playlist includes a variety of genres, such as electronic, ambient, and experimental, and features artists that explore themes related to technology, futurism, and innovation.

You can check out my Web3 playlist on Spotify by following this link: Web3 Playlist. I hope you enjoy it and find it as inspiring as I do!
